TUMitfahrer
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pkwiecien/tumitfahrer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pkwiecien/tumitfahrer)

New backend for TUMitfahrer App build with Ruby on Rails.
Any endpoint such as Android, iOS, Pebble apps can communicate with this backend via JSON or XML format.

* Test framework (Dansen)
* UI and UX (Lukasz)


API Reference
-------------

To use API, use for now http://tumitfahrer-staging.herokuapp.com/.
Each API call starts with `/api/v2` and is followed by a specific verb, e.g. http://tumitfahrer-staging.herokuapp.com/api/v2/rides.

If it's not clear what should be e.g. format of parameters, check out how is the API implemented and try to reverse engineer it. The API functions are [HERE](https://github.com/pkwiecien/tumitfahrer/tree/develop/app/controllers/api/v2). The output of API controllers is defined in serializers [HERE](https://github.com/pkwiecien/tumitfahrer/tree/develop/app/serializers).

#### Sessions

TUMitfahrer has existing user base of over 1000 users. Their passwords are obviously encrypted and cannot be read. The idea is to create a authentication system that will enable old users as well as new ones to login in. Therefore the authentication mechanism is a bit complex.

To login to TUmitfahrer you need to create a POST request to sessions. In the header `Authorization: Basic`, you should provide encrypted credentials in the form: `base64_encryption(username:sha512_encryption(password+'toj369sbz1f316sx'))`. sha512_encryption is a standard encryption algorithm whose implementation you can find on the Internet, and here it's used to encrypt password with added salt 'toj369sbz1f316sx' (the salt is taken from the old system). `username:sha512_encryption` are again encrypted with base64 encryption.

So to sum up, pass a header in form:
`Authorization: Basic base64_encryption(username:sha512_encryption(password+'toj369sbz1f316sx'))`
